openstackdotnet sdk - Usage Exmaple
====================

	This is a Web Forms example of how to consume the Openstack NET SDK V1 : http://openstacknetsdk.org/.

        When uploading a file it's temporarily stored in a temp directory so be sure to have appropriate 
	permissions in place for read/write or if using Rackspace Cloud Sites be sure to add impersonation 
	to your web.config so the file system can upload the file.
        
        I hope my example helps!
